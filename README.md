# CrystalBuff

CrystalBuff is an Ashita v4 addon for Final Fantasy XI that automatically tracks and corrects your current crystal buff—Signet, Sanction, or Sigil—based on the zone you are in.

> **Note:**  
> This addon is designed **EXCLUSIVELY** for the [CatsEyeXI private server](https://www.catseyexi.com/) and will not function as intended on retail or other private servers.  
> The required commands (`!signet`, `!sanction`, `!sigil`) and zone assignments are specific to CatsEyeXI.


## Features

- **Automatic Detection:** Monitors your active buffs and determines which crystal buff (Signet, Sanction, or Sigil) is required for your current zone.
- **Buff Correction:** If you are missing the required buff for your zone, CrystalBuff will automatically attempt to apply the correct one by issuing the appropriate command.
- **Zone Awareness:** Recognizes the zones where each buff is needed—Signet (vanilla zones), Sanction (ToAU zones), Sigil (past zones)—and adapts as you move.
- **Smart Filtering:** Automatically ignores city zones, non-combat areas, and other safe zones where crystal buffs are not needed.
- **Command Cooldown:** Built-in 10-second cooldown prevents spam and conflicts with other addons.
- **Intelligent Delays:** Uses strategic delays to ensure buff data is fully updated before making corrections.
- **Debug Mode:** Optional verbose output for troubleshooting and monitoring addon behavior.
- **Minimal Setup:** No configuration required. Just load the addon and let it keep your crystal buff up-to-date.


## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository into your Ashita v4 `addons` folder:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/seekey13/CrystalBuff.git
   ```

2. Start or restart Ashita.
3. Load the addon in-game:

   ```
   /addon load crystalbuff
   ```


## Usage

CrystalBuff runs automatically in the background. When you change zones or your buffs change, it will:

1. **Check your location:** Determines if you're in a zone that uses a crystal buff
2. **Verify your buffs:** Compares your current crystal buff against what's needed for the zone
3. **Apply corrections:** If needed, automatically issues the appropriate command to get the correct buff

### Intelligent Behavior
- **Safe Zone Detection:** Automatically ignores cities, towns, and other non-combat areas where buffs aren't needed
- **Rate Limiting:** Uses a 10-second cooldown between correction commands to prevent server command spam
- **Timing Optimization:** Employs strategic delays to ensure buff data is fully updated before making decisions
- **Error Resilience:** Robust error handling prevents crashes and provides helpful feedback

### When Corrections Happen
- If you have no crystal buff in a combat zone
- If you have the wrong crystal buff for your current zone (e.g., Signet in a ToAU zone)
- After zoning into a new area that requires a different buff
